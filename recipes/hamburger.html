        <p>A hamburger is a classic American dish that brings together the savory flavors of a juicy beef patty, nestled between two soft buns. Topped with fresh lettuce, ripe tomatoes, crispy pickles, and a drizzle of ketchup and mustard, itâ€™s a satisfying meal that can be customized to suit any palate. Whether grilled on a barbecue or cooked on a stovetop, the hamburger is a versatile option perfect for picnics, barbecues, or a cozy dinner at home.</p>

            <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired doneness.</li>

            <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the patty on the bottom bun, then adding lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, and mustard.</li>
            <li>Top with the other half of the bun and serve immediately.</li>
