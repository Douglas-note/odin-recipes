        <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the topping:</h5>

    <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
    <li>8 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    <li>4 oz pepperoni slices</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano(optional)</li>
    <li>Olive oil for drizzling</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast, and salt together. Gradually add the warm water and olive oil, stirring until a rough dough forms. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place it in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> After the dough has risen, preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Pizza:</strong> Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll or stretch the dough into a 12-inch round. Transfer it to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce, then layer the pepperoni slices on top. If you like, sprinkle dried oregano for added flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Carefully slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or place the baking sheet in the oven. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute. Slice it up and enjoy the deliciousness of homemade pepperoni pizza, perfect for sharing or enjoying all to yourself!</li>
